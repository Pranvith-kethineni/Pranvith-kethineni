Here are my featured projects. Tap/click on any project to see the code and documentation!

### 1. üì± [MUVerse ‚Äì A Social Networking App for Mahindra University](https://github.com/Pranvith-kethineni/Muverse)
 [Live App](https://muverse-mernstack-2.onrender.com/home)  
MUVerse is a university-exclusive mobile social networking platform designed to connect Mahindra University students. With real-time messaging, group chats, media sharing, and upcoming features like event announcements, MUVerse promotes collaboration, connectivity, and campus engagement in a secure, student-only ecosystem.

### 2. [ML-Project-Disease-Prediction-](https://github.com/Pranvith-kethineni/ML-Project-Disease-Prediction-)
This project demonstrates the development, training, evaluation, and deployment of a machine learning model for disease diagnosis using anonymized patient data. The pipeline utilizes the Random Forest Classifier and addresses imbalanced datasets with SMOTE. Comprehensive model evaluation and cross-validation are included for robust performance.

### 3.  [MazeSolver-Project](https://github.com/Pranvith-kethineni/MazeSolver-Project)
 [live game](https://github.com/Pranvith-kethineni/MazeSolver-Project/blob/main/MazeSolverGUI.jar)
 
The Maze Solver Project is a graphical application that allows users to generate and solve random mazes using classic algorithms. Users can interactively solve mazes or let the program demonstrate solutions using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). The project includes features to adjust maze difficulty, track completion time, and visualize maze traversal.
